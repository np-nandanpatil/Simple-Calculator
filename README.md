## Contributing

**Enhancements:**

Feel free to fork this repository and make improvements! Here are some potential areas for extension:

* There is a logical error in this code, if the following operation is performed `num1+num2+num3=` the result should be value of (`num1+num2+num3`) but we get (`num1+num2`)
* **Complex calculations:** Add support for more complex mathematical functions like trigonometry and exponents.
* **Error handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors during calculations (e.g., division by zero).
* **UI improvements:** Enhance the user interface with a more visually appealing design or additional features.
